the with statement handles opening and closing the file including if an exception is raised
in the inner block the for line in f treats the file object f as an iterable which automatically
uses buffered io and memory management so you dont have to worry about large files
also another technique that i discovered works great in some applications is parallel csv
than presplitting one big file into many part files
