\section{Conclusion and future work}
According to the experiment we conducted in \ref{experiment_results}, $conclusions$. Certainly for optimizing construction process of word embeddings there some other possible approaches may worth try. For example when we concatenate all the vectors from sub-models together, an auto-encoder can be used efficiently in dimension reduction of it \cite{hinton2006reducing}. Method like asynchronous VRSGD \cite{keuperasynchronous}, \cite{keuper2015asynchronous} provides the possibility of optimizing SGD in a parallel way.
