\subsection{Order while combining models}
  When the combination processes, extra error can be introduced because of calculation accuracy of modern computer, or some combination methods, like PCA, causes deviation per se. As combination goes by, these errors or deviations can accumulate. Therefore it's reasonable to take combination order into consideration, if we want to recover the global model in a most lossless way. In our experiment, three types of combination order are taken into the consideration. They are to introduce in the following part of this section.
  \subsubsection{Sequential order}
  \subsubsection{Binary order}
  \subsubsection{Combine two with minimum Procrustes error}
