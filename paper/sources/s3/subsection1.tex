  \subsection{Dividing corpus}
  We can divide the corpora using a interweaving way. At first we denote sentences in all of documents in corpus with integers and if we divide the whole corpus into k pieces, the t-th piece becomes all sentences that denoted as $kn+(t-1)$ (where $k\in Z_+$ and $t<k$). For example if we have the sentences numbered as 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ... in the 0th piece becomes 0, 2, 4, ... while the 1st becomes 1, 3, 5, ... Division using this way enables each piece contains different sentences, while spread each documentation into different pieces by granularity of sentence.
  If maintenance of word distribution is required for the sake of fairness, sampling methods like Bootstrap method \cite{efron1992bootstrap} can be leveraged. Still at first all of sentences contained in corpus are denoted by integers. Then sample k pieces {\`a} M/k sentences using Bootstrap method, in order to construct k sub-corpus.
