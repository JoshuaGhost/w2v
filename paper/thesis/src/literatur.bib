	abstract = {The importance of a Web page is an inherently subjective matter, which depends on the readers interests, knowledge and attitudes. But there is still much that can be said objectively about the relative importance of Web pages. This paper describes PageRank, a mathod for rating Web pages objectively and mechanically, effectively measuring the human interest and attention devoted to them. We compare PageRank to an idealized random Web surfer. We show how to efficiently compute PageRank for large numbers of pages. And, we show how to apply PageRank to search and to user navigation.}

	abstract="Given an undirected distance graph G=(V, E, d) and a set S, where V is the set of vertices in G, E is the set of edges in G, d is a distance function which maps E into the set of nonnegative numbers and S⊑V is a subset of the vertices of V, the Steiner tree problem is to find a tree of G that spans S with minimal total distance on its edges. In this paper, we analyze a heuristic algorithm for the Steiner tree problem. The heuristic algorithm has a worst case time complexity of O({\textbrokenbar}S{\textbrokenbar}{\textbrokenbar}V{\textbrokenbar}2) on a random access computer and it guarantees to output a tree that spans S with total distance on its edges no more than 2(1−1/l) times that of the optimal tree, where l is the number of leaves in the optimal tree.",

	abstract="Intelligent question-answering programs do more than retrieve ``raw'' data; they make deductive inferences in order to return all valid responses. They report logical inconsistencies, possibly at the data input phase. Similarly, more information is requested from the user if a question asked proves to be ambiguous. A question-answering system of the above type has been designed and implemented. Besides retrieving explicit and implicit temporal relations, the system discovers potentially causal relationships which also satisfy different time restrictions. Questions concerning a generalized concept of coexistence can also be answered. It is hoped that programs of a similar nature will become of much pragmatic use to researchers in physics, chemistry, biology, and so on, in evaluating complex, interrelated experimental data. Several additional applications for this type of program are mentioned, ranging from problems in criminology to air traffic control. The Associative Memory, Parallel Processing Language, AMPPL-II, was found rather satisfactory for the project. It is finally suggested that the system being described could serve as a component in a complex cognitive mechanism.",

	abstract = {We present a system for the visualization of computing literature with an emphasis on collaboration patterns, interactions between related
	research specialties and the evolution of these characteristics through time. Our computing literature visualization system, has four major components: A mapping of bibliographical data to relational schema coupled with an RDBMS to store the relational data, an
	interactive GUI that allows queries and the dynamic construction of graphs, a temporal graph layout algorithm, and an interactive visualization tool.  We use a novel technique for visualization of
	large graphs that evolve through time. Given a dynamic graph, the layout algorithm produces two-dimensional representations of each timeslice, while preserving the mental map of the graph from one slice to the next. A combined view, with all the timeslices can also be viewed and explored. For our analysis we use data from the Association of Computing Machinery's Digital Library of Scientific Literature which contains more than one hundred thousand research papers and authors. Our system can be found online at http://tgrip.cs.arizona.edu.},
